RTBot
=====

## Historical note

This is the Discord version of an IRC bot called "RTBot" that administered and entertained #rollingthunder on Quakenet for many years, roughly between 2005 and 2012.
The IRC version is preserved at https://github.com/hheimbuerger/rtbot/tree/irc, together with more historical information and some acknowledgements.

## Discord

The current version is at this point an early stage proof-of-concept of porting the bot to Python 3.6 and Discord.

## Requirements

* Python 3.5+
* `pip install --requirement requirements.txt`
* a valid Discord bot token, stored in the environment variable `DISCORD_TOKEN`
