To run the webapp, you need at least Ruby and Rails. Ruby has to be downloaded and installed manually (installer
packages are available for most platforms), Rails can be downloaded via the Ruby package manager, RubyGems, which
comes with every Ruby installation.

The instructions can be found at http://www.rubyonrails.org/down
In a nutshell:
1. Install Ruby.
2. Run "gem install rails --include-dependencies".
3. Have a local MySQL server running, filled with the schema ...
4. Run "ruby script/server" in the /webapp directory to fire up a local test server (slow, but fully functional).
