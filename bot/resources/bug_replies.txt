that's weird...
it's never done that before.
it worked yesterday.
you must have the wrong version.
it works, but it hasn't been tested.
somebody must have changed my code.
did you check for a virus?
where were you when the program blew up?
why do you want to do it that way?
I thought I fixed that.
try it again.
did you try rebooting?
it works for me.
you must be using it wrong.
why did you do that?
it's not a bug, it's a feature.
