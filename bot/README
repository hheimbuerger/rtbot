Right now, these are only snippets. More documentation will be added later. (How many
projects broke that promise already? :D)

Path structure:
/					Contains the BotManager.py, the starting code for the bot.
/debugging_pluins	Various plugins that aren't used in the production environment but for testing.
/exceptions (*)		XML files that are dumped for every exception detected in the repository. The
					filename contains the date, time and a running number per bot session.
/lib				3rd party modules necessary for running the bot.
/logs (*)			The logs created by the bot.
/modules			Core modules of the bot.
/plugins			Plugins for the bot.
/resources			Various resources needed by various plugins. Also used as a storage area for plugins.

(*) = Please do not commit the contents of these directories to the repository.

Running the bot:
Windows:
	Run the BotManager.py. (Calling "python BotManager.py" might be necessary, depending on your setup.)
Linux:
	Run the BotManager.py with a control parameter: "python BotManager.py start",
		"python BotManager.py stop", "python BotManager.py restart"

===========================================================================================================

The database connection (activated by entering a connection string in Settings.database_connection_string)
requires MySQLdb (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysqldb) and SQLObject (http://www.sqlobject.org/). It
is not necessary for running the bot, though (and deactivated by default).
